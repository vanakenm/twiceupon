# Twice upon

A fantasy world text based generator

## Versions

### v1: Arrays

Per episode:

- color (or random)
- text
  - with placeholders for variables
  - create/use a basic template system?
  - just interpolate variables? (works if the array is created after the context hash is available)

Big hash for the "context" info

## UX

Full page "screens"

- Arrow down to go to the next one
- Small sidebar with the list
- Clicking on a colored word allow to change it (reroll or select)
  - This impacts the next screens!

## Later

Models: Episode array - text with placeholders, name, data (code/value of what's needed there)
- If no episode create the first one
- When down arrow - go to next episode or create
- If not at episode 1, show top arrow to (next/previous)

Data

- save all results as a simple array that could be locally save (local storage or even url param)
- or as "token" that can be send again to url (token=XXX -> recreate story)
